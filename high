/*.Set, Clear and Toggle a Given Bit of a Number in C using functions
 Input: N = 5, K = 1
 Output: Setting Kth bit: 5
 Clearing Kth bit: 4
 Toggling Kth bit: 4
 Explanation: 5 is represented as 101 in binary and has its first bit 1, so
 Setting it will result in 101 i.e. 5.
 Clearing it will result in 100 i.e. 4.
 Toggling it will result in 100 i.e. 4.
Input: N = 7, K = 2
 Output: Setting Kth bit: 7
 Clearing Kth bit: 5
 Toggling Kth bit: 5
 Explanation: 7 is represented as 111 in binary and has its second bit 1, so
 setting it will result in 111 i.e. 7.
 clearing it will result in 101 i.e. 5.
 toggling it will result in 101 i.e. 5  */
